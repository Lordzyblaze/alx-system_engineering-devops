Database Server Failure Postmortem - on February 1st 2023 3:00 PM

Introduction

On February 1st 2023 3:00 PM, a critical failure in the database server was identified, causing a disruption to the users to access information on from the web server. The purpose of this postmortem is to document the event, identify the root cause, and outline steps taken to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

Timeline

•February 1st 2023, 3:30 PM, Database server failure detected by the monitoring system.
•February 1st 2023, 4:00 PM, I notified and started investigating the issue.
•February 1st 2023, 4:20 PM, The issue was identified as a hardware failure in the database server.
•February 1st 2023, 4:50 PM, The faulty hardware was replaced, and the database server was restored to normal operation.
•February 1st 2023, 5:20 PM, The monitoring system confirmed normal operation, and the incident was declared resolved.

Root Cause

The root cause of the database server failure was determined to be a hardware failure in one of the database server components which is system power supply and connectors. The component had reached end of life and failed, causing the database server to become unavailable.

Impact

The failure of the database server caused a significant disruption to the web system stack. The following impacts were observed:
•Users were unable to access the system data and data loss
•Data integrity was impacted, causing incorrect results to be displayed.
•The web server performance was degraded, causing slow response times and slow performance

Action Items

The following action items have been identified and prioritized to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future:
1.Replace all database server components with updated hardware to avoid end of life failures (new power supply and connectors).
2.Implement a secondary database server for redundancy to ensure high availability.
3.Regularly monitor and perform preventative maintenance on the database server system.
4.Implement regular database backups to ensure data can be recovered in the event of a failure.

Conclusion

The database server failure was caused by a hardware failure in one of the components. I was able to quickly resolve the issue and restore normal operation. Steps are being taken to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, including updating hardware, implementing redundancy, and regular backups.
